<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;OFFSET = IN 6 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;hardorb_fpga_0_PHY_rx_clk_pin&quot;;&gt; [system.pcf(22655)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.

<msg type="info" file="Route" num="538" delta="old" >One or more MIG cores have been detected in your design and have been successfully
placed and routed. These MIG core(s) have critical skew and delay requirements 
that are independent of the user (UCF) timing constraints. These MIG-related timing 
constraints have been successfully met in this design. However, the user must verify
separately that all timing constraints specified in the UCF file have been met.

The following Clock signals have USELOWSKEWLINES constraint
specified. The router was not able to completely route using
the LOW SKEW resources. Check the timing report to verify the
delay and skew for this net.
</msg>

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.
